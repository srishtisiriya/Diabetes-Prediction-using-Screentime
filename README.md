This project is a Personalized Diabetes Risk Prediction and Wellness Advisor, designed to address the increasing prevalence of diabetes in India. It is an innovative machine learning-powered system that predicts an individual’s risk of developing diabetes based on their lifestyle habits, medical history, and smartphone usage patterns.
Key Features:
1. Risk Assessment:
   - The system uses advanced algorithms to evaluate key health indicators like glucose levels, BMI, and insulin levels, alongside smartphone screen time and app usage metrics.
   - It provides a clear indication of the diabetes risk (Yes/No) and the likelihood in percentage terms.
2. Personalized Recommendations:
   - Based on the user’s risk level, the system offers tailored suggestions for diet, exercise, and screentime management.
   - For instance, it advises reducing screen time for high smartphone users or suggests specific fitness routines based on BMI.
3. Human-Centric Design:
   - Unlike generic health tools, this system is designed to adapt to individual profiles. It considers a holistic view of health by integrating both medical and behavioral data.
4. Actionable Insights:
   - The recommendations are practical and easy to implement, such as daily walks, yoga, or balanced meals, empowering users to make sustainable lifestyle changes.
Why It’s Important:
India is becoming a global hotspot for diabetes, with lifestyle factors like excessive screen time contributing significantly. This project bridges the gap between health awareness and actionable prevention strategies, helping users proactively manage their health.
In summary, this project not only predicts diabetes risk but also acts as a digital wellness companion, empowering people to take control of their health and reduce the chances of developing chronic conditions.
